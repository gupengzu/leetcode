# Big O and his friends
## big O 
there has a F(x) and G(x),there has at least one C which can make all n F(n)<= C * G(n),then F(n) is said to be in O(G(n)).
## little o
if n->infinity , F(n)/G(n)->0
## big O mega
![[big O mega.png]]
F=O mega(G) if G=O(F) 

## little omega
F=w(G) if G=o(F)
## Theta
![[theta.png]]

F=theta(G) if both F=O(G) and F=O mega(G)

| O     | <=  |
| ----- | --- |
| o     | <   |
| Omega | >=  |
| w     | >   |
| theta | =   |
